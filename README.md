MPEGBookkeeper

Author: Cody Jones 2014

MPEG Bookkeeper is a software aide which performs common and tedious data management
operations for the accounting department of Miller Pacific Engineering Group (MPEG). 
It is meant to supplement the use of existing excel spreadsheets, rather than perform 
as a standalone database and accounting program. It does so by automating four frequently
utilized accounting functions: collecting all expenses and employee hours for a work week,
sorting job costs to specific job excel spreadsheets, compiling job info for project 
managers, and summarizing cost and budget info for all projects in a single excel 
spreadsheet. The goal of MPEG Bookkeeper is to streamline the collection, storage, and
distrobution of accounting data so that the accountant may focus on keepering employees
and projects on budget.

MPEG Bookkeeper utilizes the jexcel API in order to interact with excel spreadsheets. Many
thanks to Andy Khan, the creator of this open source API. As required, MPEG Bookkeeper
extends the jexcel API's GNU General Public License 2.0. For more on the jexcel API see
